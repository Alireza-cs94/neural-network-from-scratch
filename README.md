# A Neural Network From Scratch
This was written for my blog post [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/).

Install [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (if you need to):

```bash
$ pip install numpy
```

Then, run it with no arguments:

```bash
$ python network.py
```

You can also run / play with this code on my [repl.it](https://repl.it/@vzhou842/An-Introduction-to-Neural-Networks).
